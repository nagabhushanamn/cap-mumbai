			<p>
				Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web. 
				More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities 
				can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that 
				they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, 
				including older people with changing abilities due to aging.
